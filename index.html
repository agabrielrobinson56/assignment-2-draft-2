<h1>Decades of Complaints Show West Park Church’s Deterioration Ahead of Dec. 9 Hearing</h1>
<p><strong>By Ajhada Gabriel.</strong><br>New York — December 7, 2025</p>

<h2>DOB complaint data reveals a long pattern of structural decay as the city prepares to decide whether the landmarked church can be demolished.</h2>

<p>As the Landmarks Preservation Commission prepares for a pivotal Dec. 9 hearing, newly analyzed city data shows the West Park Presbyterian Church has faced persistent safety issues for nearly 20 years. Department of Buildings complaint records for 165 West 86th Street show repeated reports of falling debris, unsafe scaffolding, and facade instability—peaking around its 2010 landmark designation and rising again in the past five years.</p>

<p>Preservation experts say the numbers reflect a broader challenge. <em>“When a building is landmarked but under-resourced, deterioration often accelerates,”</em> said Columbia preservation professor Elena Martínez. <em>“Data like this makes clear that deferred maintenance is a structural, not emotional, issue.”</em></p>

<p>The congregation argues the data supports its hardship claim for demolition, while preservationists say it shows why landmark protections are necessary.</p>
